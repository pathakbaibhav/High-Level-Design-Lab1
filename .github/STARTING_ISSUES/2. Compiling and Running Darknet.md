## 1. Create a submodule in this repo

Git [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) are a great way to integrate working across multiple sources. For this assigment darknet is in a separate repository as we will use it across multiple assignments. Read about submodules:  [github blog](https://github.blog/2016-02-01-working-with-submodules/), [Video Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSlXo2iLBro),[Git SCM Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). 

Go to your repository checkout of this repo. Add the darknet repo as a submodule with the name darknet into your lab 1 repository.  

```
git submodule add git@github.com:neu-ece-7368-f23/darknet-<TeamName>.git darknet
```

Replace `<TeamName>` with the name of your lab team. Then, the submodule refers repository created from github classroom for your team. Do not use https as a submodule URL as it requires manual authentication (and is outdated). 

With the submodule, the darknet repository appears as the sub folder `darknet` in your checkout of the lab1 repository. 

Commit adding the submodule to your lab1 repository referencing this issue. Push and inspect the github page. 

## 2. Compile Darknet with: 

```
cd darknet
make
``` 

## 3.  We will be using the pre-trained Tiny YOLO CNN for small and embedded devices. Get the pre-trained weight model from the following link:

```
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3-tiny.weights
```

## 4. Execute the yolo detector: 

```
./darknet detector test cfg/coco.data cfg/yolov3-tiny.cfg yolov3-tiny.weights data/dog.jpg -save_labels
```

The `save_labels` flag will produce the golden reference output with detected classes and bounding boxes and save it in the file `data/dog.txt`. You can also look at the generated `predictions.jpg` for a visual representation of detection results.
